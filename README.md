## Development Process

To develop the game, the following steps were followed:

### Defining  Project Goal (UX)
 *What would user want?*
- to be able feel goood and be excited about website.
- to be able to immediately start playing the game
- to have clear and concise information about progress of game and final results.
- to be able to track scores

*What are the developers goals*
-  a project that test their understanding of javascript and development of game logic.
- a site that vistors can be excited about and one that is easily navigable
- a game and a site that is fun, niche and interest-focused.
- a very simple interface that is responsive.

#### Mind map and lo-fi development
![mind map of website developed using](readmeimages/mindmap.png)
*Developed using lucidsparks*
![lo-fi of index.html ](readmeimages/lo-fi-Index.png)
*Developed using rp.mockplus. There images for all lo-fi are not on here because they are a lot, hence the rest are stored in the readmeimages folder in the lo-fi folder.
The files where developed with consideration to responsiveness. Notably, this is a mock up  and so not all design ideas where implemented in the actual product. *
### Tools used in creating website

 **Planning:** 
The requirements and features of the game were defined, including understanding the rules of Rock Paper Scissors Spock Lizard and how the game mechanics should work.
Mind maps and lo-fi mock ups where used in design what the webisye could potentially look like. The 
The game is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**HTML Structure:** The HTML structure was created, including the necessary elements like buttons, scoreboards, and game result display.

**CSS Styling:** CSS was utilized to add styles and make the game visually appealing. The layout, colors, fonts, and animations were implemented to enhance the user experience.
 **JavaScript Logic:** The game logic was implemented using JavaScript. This included functions to handle user clicks, generate random computer moves, determine the winner of each round, and update the score. Javascript was also used in implement personalisation featurs such as prompting the user's name.

 **Testing and Debugging:** The game was thoroughly tested for different scenarios and any bugs or errors were identified and fixed. This involved using browser developer tools for debugging purposes.

 **Validation:** The code was reviewed to ensure it follows best practices and is free of syntax errors or potential security vulnerabilities. Accessibility considerations were also taken into account to make the game usable by all users.

## Features
#### Index page features
It contains the header which shows the logo, a blue rocket with Sheldon's army underneath, and the other side is the home, about and follow us(leads to the footer).

5. **Reset Option:** A reset button is available to restart the game and reset the scores.

## Evaluating responsiveness and browser compatibility

## Validation and Debugging

During development, the code was validated and tested using the following methods:

1. **Syntax Validation:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code were validated using validators to identify any syntax errors or invalid code.

2. **Browser Compatibility:** The game was tested in multiple browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) to ensure cross-browser compatibility.

3. **Manual Testing:** Different scenarios were tested to verify the game logic, including all possible moves and combinations to ensure they produce the expected results.

4. **Debugging:** When issues or bugs were discovered, the browser's developer tools were utilized to find error messages, inspect variables, and trace the code to identify and fix the bugs.

5. **User Testing:** The game was shared with potential users, and their feedback was collected to identify any issues or suggestions for improvement.

By following these steps, the Rock Paper Scissors Spock Lizard game was successfully developed, ensuring its functionality, responsiveness, and user-friendliness. Enjoy playing the game, and may luck be on your side in this geeky variation of the classic game!
